## DESCRIPTION

The material class.

This class exposes all properties from a material, allowing you to animate them. You can also use it to set custom shader properties that can't be accessed through the inspector (e.g. matrices).

In order to get the material used by an object, use the `Renderer.material` property.

See Also: `Materials`, `Shaders`.
