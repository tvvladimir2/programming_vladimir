## WHAT IS A FILE?
  - A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data.
  - Data in the file depends on the format specification used, which is typically represented by an extension (.txt, .py).
  - In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.


##### Main parts of a file:
Element               |  Element
--                    |  --
1. HEADER:            |  Metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
2. DATA:              |  codeontents of the file as written by the creator or editor.
3. END OF LIFE (EOF): |  Special character that indicates the end of the file.


## FILE PATHS
The file path is a string that represents the location of a file.
PARTS:

  1. **FOLDER PATH**: the file folder location on the file system, folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows).
  ```python
  myfile = open("filename.txt", "w")            # relative path, same directory
  myfile = open("\\folder\\filename.txt", "w")  # relative path, another folder/directory
  myfile = open("..\\..\\animals.csv", "w")     # relative path, previous-previous directory
  myfile = open("F:\\folder\\text.txt")         # absolute path for (Windows):
  ```
  2. **FILE NAME**: the actual name of the file
  3. **EXTESNION**: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type


## FOLDER STRUCTURE
```
/
│
├── path/
|   │
│   ├── to/
│   │   └── cats.gif
│   │
│   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv
```


## LINE ENDINGS
##### WINDOWS:
```
Jack the Crack\r\n          # '\r' means the end of line
Jack Russell Terrier\r\n    # '\n' means the next line
```
##### UNIX:
```
Jack the Crack\r
\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r
\n
```


## CHARACHTER ENCODINGS
- Encoding of the byte data
- An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters.
- A numerical value is assigned to represent a character.
- Parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the character.

> For example, if a file was created using the UTF-8 encoding, and you try to parse it using the ASCII encoding, if there is a character that is outside of those 128 values, then an error will be thrown.
>

## COMMON ENCODINGS:
  - **ASCII** can only store 128 characters (ASCII is actually a subset of Unicode (UTF-8))
  - **Unicode** can contain up to 1,114,112 characters.


## OPENING & CLOSING
  - A file must be opened before it is edited.

##### OPEN:
```python
myfile = open('path argument', 'mode argument')   # invoking 'open()' function
myfile = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'w')              # returns: 'file object'
```

##### CLOSING FILE, Method 1:
  - Make sure you close the file properly

```python
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    myfile.close()
```

##### CLOSING FILE, Method 2:
```python
With open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as myfile:   # the file will be closed after 'with' block is finished
    # Further file processing goes here
```
##### CLOSING FILE, Method 3:
```python
myfile.close()  # not as reliable as the two before
```


## OPEN MODES
Charachter      |  Meaning
--              |  --
'r':            |  Open for reading (default)
'w':            |  Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
'rb' or 'wb':   |  Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)


## FILE OBJECT CATEGORIES
A file object is an object exposing a file-oriented API (with methods such as read() or write()) to an underlying resource.

N | CATEGORIES OF FILE OBJECTS:
--                          | --
1                           | Text files
2                           | Buffered binary files
3                           | Raw binary files


##### 1. TEXT FILE:
This is the default file object returned by open().
```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')           # open() will return a default TextIOWrapper file object:
type(file)                              # returns: <class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>
```


##### 2. BUFFERED BINARY FILE TYPES:
```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb')     #
type(file)                              # returns: <class '_io.BufferedReader'>
```

```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'wb')     #
type(file)                              # returns: <class '_io.BufferedWriter'>
```


##### 3. RAW FILE TYPES:
Generally used as a low-level building-block for binary and text streams.
```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
type(file)                              # returns: <class '_io.FileIO'>
```


## READING BYTE BY BYTE
```python
file = open('F:\\Folder\\text.txt', "r")    # text.txt contains "1234567890"
print(file.read(4))                         # returns 1234
print(file.read(4))                         # returns 5678
print(file.read(4))                         # returns 90
print(file.read(4))                         # returns 'empty'
print(myfile.read())                        # With no argument, read returns the rest of the file.
```

unsorted:
## READLINES( ) METHOD


## LIST OF LINES
```python
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
print(file.readlines()) # returns a list of lines ['1234567890\n', 'line 2\n', 'line 3\n']
file.close()
```


## ITERATE THROUGH LINES
```python
file = open("filename.txt", "r")
for line in file:
    print(line)
file.close()
```
returns:
```
Line 1 text

Line 2 text

Line 3 text
```


## LEN( ) METHOD
```python
len(open("test.txt").readlines())   # returns a number of lines
```
