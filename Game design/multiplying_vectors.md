## DESCRIPTION

1. `vector1 * float = new vector2`
2. `vector1` is paralell to `new vecotr 2`
3. `vector1` is along the same line as `new vecotr 2`
4. `vector1`, `new vecotr 2` have different length
5. `vector1`, `new vecotr 2` work for rotation and translation


**E.g.**:
`Vector3.up` length = 1
(`Vector3.up`*2) length = 2
