## DESCRIPTION

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.


*   Design patterns are nothing more than the acknowledged, formal way of solving common coding problems. The design patterns help the user to recognize the basic script as the application agents that support to decode issues. The design patterns focus not only on the common programming basics (data types, interfaces, switch statements, for-loops) but also it helps in acknowledging and incorporating useful patterns.

*   Before the GOF pattern came into being, the additional patterns exist and came from a variety of sources. These pattern designs focus on a specific problem domain like parallel processing. Also, some of the patterns focused on building a specific type of software application such as web blogs, video games, and database interactivity. Other design patterns relied on building a secure system or solving other higher-level architectural problems.

*   The design patterns provide a given platform and programming language that supports the user with shortcuts which helps the developers to implement the given pattern more easily. For example; The Java developers have aiding platform and workspace which help them to blend the patterns easily.

## How does Design Pattern in C# make Working so Easy?


*   Design Pattern in C# specializes in developing great artwork by saving time and effort. The best thing about design patterns is that they are agnostic in nature.

*   Most design patterns are not tied to a specific language. These design patterns can be applied in the various framework such as .NET, Java 2 and coding languages like Delphi, C++, C#, etc. These design patterns are readymade solutions to the problems of developers and once the behavior of pattern is learned, developers can add material to the structure using language and platform with respect to their needs and choice.

*   The nature of work and application defines the type of design pattern. The classic longhand approach or language-specific shortcuts help the developers to execute the pattern in the coding of applications and programs.

## ADVANTAGES

Some of the major pros of using Design Pattern in C# are as follows:

*   Design patterns can speed up the development process by giving tested, proven development solutions. The developers reuse the design pattern as they help them to solve various minor issues. These design patterns enable script legibility for coding developers and engineers.

*   Design patterns offer easy and simple solutions that are in a general format and doesn’t require any need. These solutions can be applied to major and specific problems of software development.

*   Additionally, the developers use these designs to communicate popular and famous names for transmissions. The old and common design patterns can be upgraded and updated with regular intervals of time.

## REQUIRED SKILLS


*   Before beginning to learn Design Pattern in C#, the users should have a good knowledge of working with objects and their problems.

*   Basic knowledge of C# language is a necessary requirement for learning Design Patterns.

*   Since design patterns are viewed as a direct approach to computer programming and a bridge between the levels of programming languages and a specific class.

*   So, prior knowledge about the same would be an added advantage for the developers.

## Why Should we use Design Pattern in C#?

While designing systems, there are three primary uses that should be taken into mind and those are:

*   Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

*   It saves your time. The user doesn’t need to use their brain to reapply a possible solution from nowhere and waste quality time

*   Design patterns are common and easily known. People know what and why they are used. When you say -I used a factory to create that object. everyone will understand what you are talking about.

*   Most of these patterns are easy to understand. Mostly the solution will be not as efficient and easy as a design pattern.

## What does the pattern consist of?

Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

| Sections in a design pattern | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intent                       | Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.                                     |
| Motivation                   | Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.                           |
| Structure                    | Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.                                  |
| Code example                 | Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern. |
| Applicability of pattern     |                                                                                                                |
| Implementation steps         |                                                                                                                |
| Relation with other patterns |                                                                                                                |

Some pattern catalogs list other useful details, such as applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns.

## Various Subsets of Design Pattern in C#

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. You can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.

The GoF book (book of four) defines 23 classic patterns, which are grouped into three broad categories:

| Various Patterns |                                                                    Meaning in Life                                                                   |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Structural       | Structural patterns work on the classification of classes and objects and developing updated tools and functions.                                    |
| Creational       | They help in giving flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given topic. Also, these help to instantiate objects into memory. |
| Behavioral       | As the name suggests, these patterns are based on  communication between objects and how the flow is operated in a dynamic  program.                 |

## STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

Structural patterns work on the classification of classes and objects and developing updated tools and functions.

| Patterns          | Description                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter Pattern   | To simplify programming, the Adapter pattern helps the developers to follow one class to the structure of another. |
| Bridge Pattern    | It helps to segregate the user interface from execution.                                                           |
| Composite Pattern | It helps the user to create new objects by the framework of preexisting objects.                                   |
| Decorator Pattern | It helps to expand the performance of an object effectively.                                                       |
| Facade Pattern    | With the help of this pattern, the developers can recognize the set of objects with a single class.                |
| Flyweight Pattern | These patterns help to maintain the usage of memory and store the state of shared objects superficially.           |
| Proxy Pattern     | It acts like a replacement or a substitute for a different object to having control entry.                         |
| Twin              | It allows the creation of two or more models in programming scripts that don’t support the twin function.          |

## CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS

They help in giving flexibility in deciding which  objects need to be created for a given topic. Also, these help to  instantiate objects into memory.

| Patterns                 | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract Factory Pattern | It contributes a platform for developing groups of related objects without disclosing their existing classes.                                  |
| Builder Pattern          | It helps in separating the making of complicated objects from its presentations. It helps to create other presentations with the same objects. |
| Factory Method Pattern   | It helps in defining the interface for developing a single object.                                                                             |
| Prototype Pattern        | It is based on creating new objects from the structure of an existing object and helps in increasing the performance.                          |
| Singleton Pattern        | It confirms a class has only one existence.                                                                                                    |
| Multiton                 | It confirms a class has only named existences.                                                                                                 |

## BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

As the name suggests, these patterns are based on  communication between objects and how the flow is operated in a dynamic  program.

| Patterns                         | Description                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chain of Responsibility Pattern: | It chains the receiving objects and transfers the request until the objects control it.                        |
| Command Pattern:                 | It sends the request as an object. It supports the usage of non-doable operations.                             |
| Interpreter Pattern:             | It defines a representation with an interpreter that uses the presentation to tell sentences in the language   |
| Iterator Pattern:                | It allows access to the elements of an aggregate object.                                                       |
| Mediator Pattern:                | It shows how a set of objects interact and communicate.                                                        |
| Memento Pattern:                 | It allows to store and capture objects internal properties that help to restore the state of the object later. |
| Observer Pattern:                | It defines the dependency between objects where one change results in the modification of all its dependents.  |
| Null Object:                     | It helps in avoiding null preferences by supporting with a default object.                                     |
| Visitor:                         | It works on operations to be performed on the different parts of an object model.                              |
