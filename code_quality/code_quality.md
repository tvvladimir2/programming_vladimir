## DESCRIPTION

Code quality is a set of attributes and standards that the organization has defined and prioritized. The following are the primary characteristics that can help improve code quality:

1. Clarity:
   
   The code is simple to read and maintain for anyone who isn’t the writer. It is much easier to maintain and extend code that is simple to understand. Not only computers but also humans must comprehend it.

2. Maintainable:
   
   Good code isn’t overly complicated. Anyone dealing with the code must grasp the entire context of the code to make modifications.

3. Well Documented:
   
   It’s ideal if the code is self-explanatory, but it’s always a good idea to add comments to the code to describe its purpose and functions. It makes it considerably easier for anyone who did not contribute to the code’s creation to comprehend and maintain it.

4. Well-tested:
   
   The lower the number of flaws in the code, the greater its quality. Thorough testing eliminates important flaws, ensuring that the software functions as intended.

5. Refactored:
   
   Code formatting must be consistent and adhere to the coding rules of the language.

6. Extendable:
   
   The code you get must be able to be extended. It’s not ideal when you have to discard it after a few weeks.

7. Efficiency:
   
   High-quality code does not waste resources to achieve the desired activity.

A good piece of code does not have to match all of the criteria listed above, but the more it does, the better the outcome of the software would be. These specifications are more akin to a priority list based on the specifics of your project.
