| Structural       | Structural patterns work on the classification of classes and objects and developing updated tools and functions.                                      |
| Creational       | They help in giving flexibility in deciding which  objects need to be created for a given topic. Also, these help to  instantiate objects into memory. |
| Behavioral       | As the name suggests, these patterns are based on  communication between objects and how the flow is operated in a dynamic  program.                   |
