| 1 | String(Char*)                          | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the value indicated by a specified pointer to an array of Unicode characters.                                                                                |
| 2 | String(Char*, Int32, Int32)            | Initializes a new instance of the String  class to the value indicated by a specified pointer to an array of  Unicode characters, a starting character position within that array, and  a length.              |
| 3 | String(Char, Int32)                    | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the value indicated by a specified Unicode character repeated a specified number of times.                                                                   |
| 4 | String(Char[])                         | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the Unicode characters indicated in the specified character array.                                                                                           |
| 5 | String(Char[], Int32, Int32)           | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the value indicated by an array of Unicode characters, a starting character position within that array, and a length.                                        |
| 6 | String(ReadOnlySpan'<'Char'>')             | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the Unicode characters indicated in the specified read-only span.                                                                                            |
| 7 | String(SByte*)                         | Initializes a new instance of the String class to the value indicated by a pointer to an array of 8-bit signed integers.                                                                                       |
| 8 | String(SByte*, Int32, Int32)           | Initializes a new instance of the String  class to the value indicated by a specified pointer to an array of  8-bit signed integers, a starting position within that array, and a  length.                     |
| 9 | String(SByte*, Int32, Int32, Encoding) | Initializes a new instance of the String  class to the value indicated by a specified pointer to an array of  8-bit signed integers, a starting position within that array, a length,  and an Encoding object. |
