## DESCRIPTION

In C#, arrays are actually objects, and not just addressable regions of contiguous memory as in C and C++. Array is the abstract base type of all array types. You can use the properties and other class members that Array has.

The Array class provides many other useful methods and properties for sorting, searching, and copying arrays.
