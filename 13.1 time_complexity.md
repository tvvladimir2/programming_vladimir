**Wrong questions to ask:**
- [ ] `How much time does it take to run this function?`

**Right questions to ask:**
- [x] `How does the runtime of the program grow as the size of the input grows?`

**Time Complexity** = a way of showing how the runtime of a program/function increases

##### TIME COMPLEXITY: LINEAR TIME `O(n)`
```python
x = 1                         # input size
given_array = [*range(1, x, 1)] # generate list

total = 0
for i in given_array:
    total += 1

print(total)    # T:O(n) linear complexity
```

##### TIME COMPLEXITY: CONSTANT TIME `O(1)`

##### TIME COMPLEXITY: QUADRATIC TIME `O(n**2)`

Brute force
interate through entire array which is length 10
and do it potentially 'n' times for each number in the array
worst case time complexity is big 'O' of n squared >> `O(n**2)`

time complexity in the worst scenario is big 'O' of n >> T: O(n) (linear algorithm to solve the problem)
