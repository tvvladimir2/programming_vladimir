# PYTHON COLLECTIONS (ARRAYS) =================================================

# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # - List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")  # - Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}    # - Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
thisdictionary = {                       # - Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.
